### Description

This is lesson 4 in my fractal quest. This one is intended to explain some concepts related with fractals like recursion, backtracking and other. Code is heavily commented, I have uploaded also 3 simpler examples along these code (Fibonacci) and I also wrote a large tutorial that will explain the background of my source code. First, you shoud read a pdf tutorial, second view simpler examples until you fully understand them and then at last - Dust Fractal source code. The Code itself can generate 8 different graphics.

So, I know this lesson is not very easy to understand but try to have fun with it, I really tried to make it as simple as I can.
